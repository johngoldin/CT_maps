## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(rgdal)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(curl)
```
```{r ctdata}
ctpop <- read.csv("brr2000v04_townbyasrh.csv")
ctpop <- filter(ctpop, str_length(town) < 100, str_length(age_group) > 0)
ctpop$town <- str_replace(ctpop$town, "\n", "") # north stonington had a newline character
last_town <- ""
for(i in 1:length(ctpop$town)) {
  if(ctpop$town[i] == "") ctpop$town[i] <- last_town
  else last_town <- ctpop$town[i]
}
ctpop_race <- group_by(ctpop, town) %>% summarize(white = sum(males_white_non_hispanic + females_white_non_hispanic),
                                          black = sum(males_black + females_black),
                                          asian = sum(males_pac_islander + females_pac_islander),
                                          hispanic = sum(males_hispanic + females_hispanic),
                                          total = white + black + asian + hispanic,
                                          white_pct = white / total,
                                          black_pct = black / total,
                                          asian_pct = asian / total,
                                          hispanic_pct = hispanic / total)

```
```{r}
rc <- curl_download("http://www.ct.gov/opm/lib/opm/igp/mill_rates/fy_2017_mill_rates.xlsx", "mill_rates2015.xlsx")
mill_rates <- read_excel("mill_rates2015.xlsx")
names(mill_rates) <- c("code", "service_district_code", "Municipality", "FY2017_mill_rate", "personal_prop_rate", "motor_vehicle_rate") 
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
